Version 1
* Initial baseline

Version 2
---12-7-2020---

Top Cover
* Changed color to an off black
* Increased 4-40 hole from 72 thou radius to 80 thou
** Found that the lower right hole was 70 not 72 thou which explains the single very tight hole!
* Changed copper pipe cutout from subtractive part to parameteric.


Main Front Clamp
* Changed color to an off black
* Increased PVC tab to 1.25" to give room for washers
* Increased 1/4 holes from radius 0.1285" to 0.1555" to reach 0.311" diameter loose clearance
** I also think I may be able to improve dimensions by adjusting CURA estimated PLA shrinkage.
* Updated copper pipe radius cutout to face pocket parametric rather than subrative part workbench.
* Added 100 thou chamfer to the fastener legs to main body to reduce stress riser (May not be needed with below addition of supports)
* Added 200 thou dual supports to bolt mounts and main support body

Back Clamp
* Changed color to an off black
* Increased PVC tab to 1.25" to give room for washers and match main front clamp
* Increased 1/4 holes from radius 0.1285" to 0.1555" to reach 0.311" diameter loose clearance
* Added tangental bolt supports of 200 thou on each side to support the bolt mount
* Added 100 thou chamfer to to bolt to pvc curve to reduce stress risers (may not be needed with above supports)

Version 3
------
General
* Created octagon copper pipe for mag loop
* Moved bottom clamp parts down to bottom of octagon
* Found bottom cover copper cutout was only through half of part, fixed.
